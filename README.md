#Â racer-socket.io
A [Socket.io](http://socket.io/) transport for racer. Socket.io will
start a connection with ajax polling, and later upgrade to websockets
where possible.

## Usage
`racer-socket.io` needs your racer store, as well as your express
[cookieParser](cookie-parser) and [session](session) middlewares in
order to fetch your user's sessions:

```javascript
var racerSocketIo = require('racer-socket.io'),
  store = racer.createStore(),
  cookieParser = require('cookie-parser')(...),
  session = require('express-session')(...);

var attach = racerSocketIo(store, {
  cookieParser: cookieParser,
  session: session
});
```

Use the returned `attach` function to attach socket.io to your server:

```javascript
var server = http.createServer(expressApp);
attach(server);
```

[session]: https://github.com/expressjs/session
